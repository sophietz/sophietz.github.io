## About me
My name is Linus Rudbeck and I am a passionate business leader with a focus on helping companies digitalize their operations. I have over eight years of programming experience and advanced knowledge in C#, Java, HTML, JS, and CSS. I have held various positions in the tech industry, including project manager, team leader, and CTO. At Red Capes IT, I co-founded the company and work as a programmer and project manager, helping businesses with digitalization, analysis, marketing, automation, apps, websites, and online stores. I also have key competencies in project management, system architecture, leadership, and developing agile project plans.

In addition to my technical skills, I am proficient in English and Swedish and have received certifications in data analytics, implementing a data warehouse with Microsoft SQL Server 2012, and learning ASP.NET Core MVC. I am currently the education manager at Distansakademin, where I develop and deliver courses. I have also served as the interim CTO at Seekly, where I developed a large portion of the company's backend and led the development of the Android application.

I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow and learn in the tech industry. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to connecting and discussing how I can contribute to the success of your company.
